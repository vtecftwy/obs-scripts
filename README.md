# Introduction
These are a set of scripts and assets (scenes saved as json file) I use with OBS during online presentations.

Feel free to take the code and configs for you own use. Bear in mind that they are experimental and only tested on my own plaform. They are shared as is. 

Feel free to share improvement or suggestion, but there is no support provided for these on this repo.

Enjoy.
