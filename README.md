# Introduction
These are a set of scripts and assets (scenes saves as json file) I use with OBS during online presentations.

Feel free to take the code and configs for you own use. Bear in mind that they are experimental and only tests on my own plaform. They are share as it. Feel free to share improvement or suggestion, but there is no support provided for these.

Enjoy
